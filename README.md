# Portfolio

This will be a work-in-progress project that I work on as time allows. I really want my portfolio to be more vibrant than the one I currently have, and I've learned alot about creating websites since my first pass at a portfolio, so I want to show what I've learned!

I've decided to use React, mostly just for practice and because it literally just makes more sense to me. I like the way React is structured in your directory during development, and the component-based nature of it feels easier to swallow as a project gets bigger and bigger. 
One of the main things I want to accomplish with this new portfolio is an expandable projects section. I basically want to be able to put on display every project I publish so I don't have to pick and choose which 3 projects I include. 
Also, my first portfolio is pretty dark, I want this one to be brighter and more dynamic. So that's what I'm going for.

Init commit.

Also added some basic file structure and some styling to the header. I've found that I really like nesting my components into the sections where they go. It helps to keep the Components folder looking clean and I think is much more descriptive as to what's happening in each component.
